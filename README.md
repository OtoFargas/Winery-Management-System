# Winery-Management-System

Create an information system that will allow a person to manage its own winery in a better way.  The main user role can manage the yearly wine harvest, annotating the quality, quantity of different types of grapes. Then he will manage the wines that can be produced depending on the type of grapes available and other ingredients. The user can also manage the list of wine bottles sold and stocked and available to buyers. Buyers can consult the system to buy quantities of wine bottles, also leaving feedback about the quality of the wine they have bought.
